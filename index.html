    <h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to LBYEC2A!</h2>
    <h3>Today we would learn HTML</h3>
    <h4>also known as Hypertext Markup Language</h4>
    <p>
        All of the webpages we see in the Internet is created via HTML. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Just some trivia: we initially envisioned World Wide Web as a text-based communication. That's why we see some tags like h1,h2,h3, and even paragraphs because we can think of it as if we are writing on a word document.
